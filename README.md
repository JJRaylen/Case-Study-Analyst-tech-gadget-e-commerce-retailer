# Demand Forecasting
## Overview

The data we use to guide our demand prediction process was originally provided by an online
electronics retailer. For confidentiality purposes, we have anonymized the data and performed a
series of slight modifications.

This dataset reports the weekly sales of a tech-gadget e-commerce retailer over a period of 100
weeks, from October 2016 to September 2018. It includes the weekly sales of 44 items, also called
stock-keeping units (SKUs), as well as diverse information on these SKUs.

The raw data often consists of a collection of isolated transactions. For example, each row in the raw
dataset can correspond to a specific transaction that includes several fields, such as timestamp,
price, store (in the case of a centralized dataset across multiple stores), promotion information,
loyalty card information (if available), SKU-related features (e.g., color, brand, size), and customer
information (e.g., past purchases, clicks).

## Main Task
We would like to how to predict demand in retail
environments using some standard datasets. You
are requested to do the following steps:

Data processing and modeling factors

Common demand prediction methods (including
feature selection and regularization)

Evaluation and visualization

Optional

Clustering techniques

The Prophet method
